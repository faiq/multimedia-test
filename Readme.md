#Multimedia LLC Coding Challenge

##The Challenges

1. Write a script that takes a file containing a number of tags words (one per line) and sorts them by the number of times they occur in the file (descending order), but exclude words that only occur once. Ignore the case of the words, and filter out any puncutation characters. The output should be the word, followed by a space and the number of times it occurs in the file.

2. Write a script that removes blank paragraphs from a piece of html. A blank paragraph should be considered to be a <p> </p> tag containing only white space.
